  # max_vel_theta: 0.3 # Maximum angular velocity of the robot in radians/sec

  # #The following parameters are relevant only for carlike robots:
  # min_turning_radius: 0.0 # Minimum turning radius of a carlike robot (set to zero for a diff-drive robot).
  # wheelbase: 1.0 # The distance between the rear axle and the front axle. The value might be negative for back-wheeled robots (only required if ~<name>/cmd_angle_instead_rotvelis set to true).
  # cmd_angle_instead_rotvel: false # Substitute the rotational velocity in the commanded velocity message by the corresponding steering angle [-pi/2,pi/2]. Note, changing the semantics of yaw rate depending on the application is not preferable. Here, it just complies with the inputs required by the stage simulator. Datatypes in ackermann_msgs are more appropriate, but are not supported by move_base. The local planner is not intended to send commands by itself.

# # Trajectory Configuration Parameters
#   dt_ref: 0.3 # Desired temporal resolution of the trajectory (the trajectory is not fixed to dt_ref since the temporal resolution is part of the optimization, but the trajectory will be resized between iterations if dt_ref +-dt_hysteresis is violated.
#   dt_hysteresis: 0.1 # Hysteresis for automatic resizing depending on the current temporal resolution, usually approx. 10% of dt_ref is recommended
#   min_samples: 3 # Minimum number of samples (should be always greater than 2)
#   global_plan_overwrite_orientation: true # Overwrite orientation of local subgoals provided by the global planner (since they often provide only a 2D path)
#   max_global_plan_lookahead_dist: 3.0 # Specify the maximum length (cumulative Euclidean distances) of the subset of the global plan taken into account for optimization. The actual length is than determined by the logical conjunction of the local costmap size and this maximum bound. Set to zero or negative in order to deactivate this limitation.
#   force_reinit_new_goal_dist: 1.0 # Reinitialize the trajectory if a previous goal is updated with a separation of more than the specified value in meters (skip hot-starting)
#   feasibility_check_no_poses: 4 # Specify up to which pose on the predicted plan the feasibility should be checked each sampling interval.
#   publish_feedback: false # Publish planner feedback containing the full trajectory and a list of active obstacles (should be enabled only for evaluation or debugging). See list of publishers above.
#   shrink_horizon_backup: true # Allows the planner to shrink the horizon temporary (50%) in case of automatically detected issues (e.g. infeasibility). Also see parameter shrink_horizon_min_duration.
#   allow_init_with_backwards_motion: false # If true, underlying trajectories might be initialized with backwards motions in case the goal is behind the start within the local costmap (this is only recommended if the robot is equipped with rear sensors).
#   exact_arc_length: false # If true, the planner uses the exact arc length in velocity, acceleration and turning rate computations (-> increased cpu time), otherwise the Euclidean approximation is used.
#   shrink_horizon_min_duration: 10.0 # Specify minimum duration for the reduced horizon in case an infeasible trajectory is detected (refer to parameter shrink_horizon_backup in order to activate the reduced horizon mode).

# # Obstacle Parameters
#   min_obstacle_dist: 0.5 # Minimum desired separation from obstacles in meters
#   include_costmap_obstacles: true # Specify if obstacles of the local costmap should be taken into account. Each cell that is marked as obstacle is considered as a point-obstacle. Therefore do not choose a very small resolution of the costmap since it increases computation time. In future releases this circumstance is going to be addressed as well as providing an additional api for dynamic obstacles.
#   costmap_obstacles_behind_robot_dist: 1.0 # Limit the occupied local costmap obstacles taken into account for planning behind the robot (specify distance in meters).
#   obstacle_poses_affected: 30 # Each obstacle position is attached to the closest pose on the trajectory in order to keep a distance. Additional neighbors can be taken into account as well. Note, this parameter might be removed in future versions, since the the obstacle association strategy has been modified in kinetic+. Refer to the parameter description of legacy_obstacle_association.
#   inflation_dist: 0.6 # Buffer zone around obstacles with non-zero penalty costs (should be larger than min_obstacle_dist in order to take effect). Also refer to the weight weight_inflation.
#   include_dynamic_obstacles: false # If this parameter is set to true, the motion of obstacles with non-zero velocity (provided via user-supplied obstacles on topic ~/obstacles or obtained from the costmap_converter) is predicted and considered during optimization via a constant velocity model. New
#   legacy_obstacle_association: false # The strategy of connecting trajectory poses with obstacles for optimization has been modified (see changelog). You can switch to the old/previous strategy by setting this parameter to true. Old strategy: for each obstacle, find the nearest TEB pose; new strategy: for each teb pose, find only "relevant" obstacles.
#   obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor: 1.5 # The non-legacy obstacle association strategy tries to connect only relevant obstacles with the discretized trajectory during optimization. But all obstacles within a specifed distance are forced to be included (as a multiple of min_obstacle_dist). E.g. choose 2.0 in order toenforce the consideration obstacles within a radius of 2.0*min_obstacle_dist. [This parameter is used only if parameter legacy_obstacle_association is false]
#   obstacle_association_cutoff_factor: 5 # See obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor, but beyond a multiple of [value]*min_obstacle_dist all obstacles are ignored during optimization. Parameter obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor is processed first. [This parameter is used only if parameter legacy_obstacle_association is false]

  # # The following parameters are relevant only if costmap_converter plugins are desired (see tutorial):
  # costmap_converter_plugin: "" # Define plugin name in order to convert costmap cells to points/lines/polygons. Set an empty string to disable the conversion such that all cells are treated as point-obstacles.
  # costmap_converter_spin_thread: true # If set to true, the costmap converter invokes its callback queue in a different thread.
  # costmap_converter_rate: 5.0 # Rate that defines how often the costmap_converter plugin processes the current costmap (the value should not be much higher than the costmap update rate) [in Hz].

# # Optimization Parameters
#   no_inner_iterations: 5 # Number of actual solver iterations called in each outerloop iteration. See param no_outer_iterations.
#   no_outer_iterations: 4 # Each outerloop iteration automatically resizes the trajectory according to the desired temporal resolution dt_ref and invokes the internal optimizer (that performs no_inner_iterations). The total number of solver iterations in each planning cycle is therefore the product of both values.

#   weight_acc_lim_theta: 1.0 # Optimization weight for satisfying the maximum allowed angular acceleration
#   weight_kinematics_nh: 1000.0 # Optimization weight for satisfying the non-holonomic kinematics (this parameter must be high since the kinematics equation constitutes an equality constraint, even a value of 1000 does not imply a bad matrix condition due to small 'raw' cost values in comparison to other costs).
#   weight_kinematics_forward_drive: 1.0 # Optimization weight for forcing the robot to choose only forward directions (positive transl. velocities). A small weight (e.g. 1.0) still allows driving backwards.

#   weight_viapoint: 1.0 # Optimization weight for minimzing the distance to via-points (resp. reference path). New in version 0.4
#   weight_inflation: 0.1 # Optimization weight for the inflation penalty (should be small).
#   weight_adapt_factor: 2.0 # Some special weights (currently weight_obstacle) are repeatedly scaled by this factor in each outer TEB iteration (weight_new = weight_old*factor). Increasing weights iteratively instead of setting a huge value a-priori leads to better numerical conditions of the underlying optimization problem.

# # Parallel Planning in distinctive Topologies

Warning: reduce this parameter only, if you observe problems with too many obstacles in the local cost map, do not choose it extremly low, otherwise obstacles cannot be distinguished from each other (0.2<value<=1).
